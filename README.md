## üî• TL;DR

A **cross-platform Delphi FireMonkey** mobile app that plans a full day out in a new city:  
- Users **swipe** activities/restaurants **left/right** (Tinder-style), and the app computes an **optimized day plan**.  
- Pulls **Google Maps** data, mixes in **group preferences**, budgets, and constraints, and uses **AI (DeepSeek R1)** to curate and finalize the trip.  
- Runs on **Android/Windows**, with a **local SQLite** cache for speed and fewer API calls.

## üî• Overview

**CitySwipe** helps visitors decide **what to do today** in an unfamiliar city.  
Workflow: create a **Group Profile** (accessibility, vibe, energy, kids count, budget), start a **New Trip**, then swipe suggested activities/restaurants. The app merges your choices with live **Google Maps** data and outputs a **route/plan** for the day. Built end-to-end in **FireMonkey** with **animated UI** and strong color hierarchy.

---

## üé• Key Features

- **Tinder-Style Swiping UI**  
  Swipe **right** to like and **left** to skip; the AI generates a day plan from your kept cards. (Fully animated; uses haptics on Android via an OS bridge.)

- **Group Profiles & Trip Settings**  
  Rich profiles drive personalization (mood, social level, energy, style, accessibility, etc.). Trip sliders control **budget per person**, **activity count**, and **max distance**.

- **Google Maps + Local Caching**  
  Fetches **top activities & restaurants**, then **caches** them in a local **CityInfo** table (place id, price, rating, accessibility flags, photo ref, hours, etc.). Reduces network calls and speeds up swiping.

- **AI Curation & Finalization**  
  DeepSeek evaluates **group prefs + city data** to propose **swipeable cards** and then compute the **final trip** from your likes. Large prompt context (‚âà**35k tokens**) with retries if the model returns invalid JSON. Sub-$1 per trip if within Google Maps‚Äô free tier.

- **Distance Math**  
  Calculates straight-line distances with the **Haversine formula** to help score feasibility and filter results.

- **SQLite-Backed History**  
  Saves **Previous Trips** (plus a JSON file of places per trip) for quick reload; **Groups** can be saved/loaded for reuse.

- **Helpful Dev Ergonomics**  
  - Android packaging via `assets\internal\` deployment for data files  
  - Heavy `try..except`‚Äî**run without debugger** to avoid break-on-handled exceptions

## üåê Custom Google API Wrapper for Delphi

CitySwipe uses a **home-built Delphi wrapper** around the Google Maps **Places API**:  
- üöÄ **Strongly Typed Delphi Classes:** Encapsulated requests and responses into customer classes for easier integration.  
- üß© **Field Masking:** Calls use minimal fields to keep payload sizes small while still capturing all essential place data.  
- üîÑ **Automatic Caching:** Results are written to a **local SQLite database** so repeat calls for the same city or location are avoided, reducing API usage.  
- ‚ö° **Error Handling:** Built-in retries, JSON validation, and fallback logic to gracefully handle timeouts or malformed data.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly Design:** The wrapper simplifies calling Google APIs in Delphi by abstracting REST calls into simple, reusable methods, making it straightforward to extend or swap endpoints.

This wrapper gave CitySwipe **mobile-ready performance** and showed I can **reverse-engineer APIs** and build clean integration layers in Delphi.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Model (SQLite)

- **tblGroups** ‚Äì persisted group profiles (name, accessibility, energy, social level, vibe, style, kids, etc.)  
- **PreviousTrips** ‚Äì trip metadata + path to trip‚Äôs **Activities.json** on device  
- **CityInfo** ‚Äì cached places (id, price, rating, flags like **GoodForGroups**, **HasKidsMenu**, **IsReservable**, etc.) pulled from Maps until the city changes  

---

## üß† Notable Engineering Bits

- **FMX Mobile from scratch:** learned myself **FireMonkey** + **Android** build/deploy independently, including device targets and USB debugging.
- **Android OS bridges:** implemented device **vibration** and OS hooks where Delphi lacks direct APIs (Android ‚ÄúJS injections‚Äù technique).
- **Robust JSON layer:** end-to-end serialization for AI I/O and for **Activities.json** trip files.
- **Field-masked Places API calls:** pragmatic use of Google‚Äôs fields + local caching to keep runs **fast & cheap**.

## üéØ Why This Project Matters

‚úÖ Built a **real** mobile app with **animated UI** and color theory  
‚úÖ Combined **AI reasoning** with **live geodata** and user preferences  
‚úÖ Designed for **offline-ish performance** via **SQLite caching**  
‚úÖ Strong **software architecture** (classes, arrays for likes/dislikes, overloads)

## üîó Design & Dev Notes

- **Design prototype (Figma):** CitySwipe UI flow & visuals  
- **Run notes:** Windows x64 or Android; include DataFiles in deployment  
- **Limitations:** DeepThink can be slower; Delphi FMX dynamic components can visually glitch under rapid updates (UI refresh fixes it)
